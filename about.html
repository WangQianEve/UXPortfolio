    <div class="about-body">I currently work in the smart-home industry, where I constantly think beyond the screens and
        explore the relationship between humans and technology. Iâ€™m also very interested in other emerging technologies
        like AI, AR/VR and how they can become great design media. Check out this Medium article I wrote about some of my learnings on <a href="https://qianwang-design.medium.com/ai-design-guidelines-i-learned-from-grad-school-and-online-resources-32fe64180b6d" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkblue">AI Design</a>.

    <div class="title">Education background</div>
    <div class="about-body">I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, Master of Humanâ€“Computer Interaction program.
        Before that, I got my Bachelorâ€™s of Computer Science at Tsinghua University (China), with a focus on HCI
        technologies. This background has not only given me more solid understanding of technologies but also stronger
        logical thinking.
